# The WeatherApp

## Description
This is a weather dashboard to search for weather conditions by city. It uses the OpenWeather One Call API to retrieve weather data.

 Once a user enters a city into the seacrch field and selects Search, the current day and five day forecast is displayed. The app also uses local storage to display cities that were recently searched which can also be clicked to display that city's weather again.
